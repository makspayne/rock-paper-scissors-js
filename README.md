# rock-paper-scissors-js

It's time to put what I've learned about JavaScript so far.

I'm going to make a simple implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”.

For the moment we’re just going to play the game from the browser console, but I will revisit this project in a later lesson and add a Graphical User Interface with buttons and text.
